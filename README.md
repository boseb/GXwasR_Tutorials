# GXwasR Tutorials <img src="logo/logo.svg" align="right" height="139" alt="" />

Welcome to the GXwasR tutorial hub — a central location for learning how
to use the GXwasR R package for genome-wide and x-chromosome wide
association studies, quality control, ancestry estimation, and more.

> ⚠️ These tutorials are now also available via the [GXwasR pkgdown
> site](https://github.com/boseb/GXwasR), though this repository remains
> as a familiar entry point for users and contributors.
